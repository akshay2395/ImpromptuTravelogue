           Everyone has their own idea of what heaven is like. For some, it has beautiful angels and for some it has lavish food. But my version of heaven is very similar to this one place on Chamba-Mussoorie Road, called Dhanaulti. A quaint hill station, away from the touristy bustle of the Doon Valley, this is the place to stay if crowds don’t suit you. <br>
Coming from Chamba, we took a taxi till Surkanda hill. We had begun to notice snow patches on the side of the road. The road is really narrow with a valley on one side. The Surkanda Devi temple is on a hill (small one hour trek). Unfortunately, we could not do the climb with all the luggage! So we rerouted Dhanaulti (7 kms). This road is often closed due to snow, but we were lucky to get a pass. It is very slippery though, and it is common to see vehicles being stuck or slipping on the ice. In such a case people are needed to give a push to keep the vehicle on path. Inching forward, our jeep somehow reached. Now, I'm used to seeing the brown monkeys at all places in Mumbai. What I never expected was to see those fellas playing in the snow x,000 feet above! <br>
        	We got down and started scouting for a place to stay. After asking around, we finally got a valley-side room. From the balcony, the mountains seemed to fade one behind the other in shades of blue. The pine trees were garnished with snow. Down below, one can see terraces like white sheets of paper, with little houses here and there. But still, the most fulfilling sight was the thick red velvety quilt on the bed! The mercury easily falls below 0 in these parts and any extra warmth is welcomed! <br>
        	After a quick bite, we ran to play in the snow. Throwing snow-balls looks tempting in cartoons, but in reality it hurts. Oh, and you fall on your ass every other second! As you go away from the road, the snow gets knee-deep. One of the main attractions of the place is the Eco Park. It's a snow park with children’s' rides and good photo shoot location. During sunset, shadows of the pine trees fall right across the park and gives it a golden glow. <br>
        	To get an overall experience of the place, I would suggest taking a stroll. The snow-covered trees overhanging on the road make for a beautiful walk. It feels like being on the sets of Game of Thrones, and well, I’ll let the pictures speak for me. :) </p>
