“ Jaana tha Japan, Pahunch gaye Chin(a) “. This popular bollywood lyric reminiscent our Gorakhgad trek. 
Our group was of five people, Manas, Nachiket, Sarvesh, Pinakin and me (Akshay).

Earlier, we planned to wander near Ahupe Ghat,mid-October, as it were just a month after monsoon ended. Things changed during our commute to Murbad and after a short chat with the local rickshaw-wallah, we subdued our mind to trek Gorakhgad.<br>
<b>Folklore</b> : The fort is named after Sant Gorakhnath. It is believed that he performed his worship or expiation here. It was used in the era of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a stopover point from Junnar via Naneghat. Its twin Machindragad stands tall not so far.<br>
<b>How to get there :</b><br>
By car : Locate Dehri, Murbad in Google maps and drive straight to the base village<br>
By local transport : If you stay in Mumbai , reach Kalyan/Thane railway station and get a ST bus to Murbad. From there you can either hire an auto to Dehri or get on another ST bus which frequents every hour till 10 PM.<br>
<b>THE TREK :</b><br>
The plan was to meet at Kalyan station by 5PM. Due to delay in renting tents, we reached there around 9PM. As we weren’t expecting any food availability in Murbad or Dehri, We dined at a nearby restaurant and parceled some biryani and bananas for the journey. Murbad st depot is at a 30-40 minutes drive from Kalyan. <br>
<b>10.30 PM</b><br>
We missed the last bus to Dehri. It is difficult to hire an auto to Dehri at this time for the day. Sarvesh and Nachiket enquired with some auto drivers and rest of us enquired with a ST driver. We were very lucky to find a driver who agreed to drop us near the temple , the start of trek, as he lived not far from there.<br>
The thin country road, pitch black night, cool breeze, big farmlands, the mighty sahyadris nearing and small villages on the way were a perfect beginning for the journey. We were constantly joking and terrifying each other using darkness as a tool. Everyone was a bit nervous about the trek at that moment but equally excited too.<br>
<b>11.30 PM</b><br>
The start of the trek is from the right of the temple. We put on our torches , gripped our shoes, wished luck and off we went. First few steps were easy but as we went ahead the path narrowed and the land grew more inclined.<br>
This was definitely not an easy trek. The trail to the fort had itchy plants on both side and covered the top as well. We made our way using sticks we got along and kept talking, mostly bullshit :p<br>
We took break after every half an hour with some refreshments we carried. The spots chosen had an amazing view of the locality as with physical rest , one also needs mental relaxation. The rest of the trek was quite the same. There are signs such cloth pieces tied to trees to lead you. Or you can always trust the direction of the flag which hurls on the fort.<br>
<b>1.30 PM</b><br>
We were very tired at this moment and didn’t have enough energy to ascend for another hour. Whereas, this place, little offtrack was flat and grassy at the end of a cliff with a couple of beautiful green peaks in front. Probably, there was no one except us in that area. We were literally in nature’s lap as they say. This was a perfect place to camp out for the night. After some time, both the tents were pitched, the campfire was lit and music was put on. We partied for another hour and had some food.<br>
<b>3.15 PM</b><br>
Party songs replaced soft music. Everyone was in their zone, soothing calmness was all around us. We were all relishing the moment in the woods and just thinking how small we are before the mighty mother earth.<br>
Soon everyone got back to their tents for a nap.
<br>

<b>6 PM</b><br>
The alarm was set for 6 as we wanted to witness the sunrise.The dawn slowly took over the darkness above us.The light was perfect to click some pictures.
