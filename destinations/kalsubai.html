    <h1 class="destinationHeader">Night trek and Camping at Kalsubai Peak</h1>
    <h5>Written By Akshay Mehta | Published on 11th October 2017</h5>

           <p>The date was June 1st,2017. We had taken the 8th semester university exam two days ago. We were to embark on different routes here on, about to seperate. Four years of college friendship needed a last road together, a spectacular farewell and what could be better for trekkers other than conquering the highest peak in the province they live, the Kalsubai peak of Maharashtra. This is another night trek by us. Early June is the best time to trek this place. The weather is pleasant, there's a constant breeze flowing, the evening is dusky, there's a presence of sweet smell of ripe mangoes that are scattered on the ground and guess what, it's the mating season of fire flies. The magic of nature is so unbelievable during this month that you'll be a witness to the sky and the land litting up by stars and fire flies on the same night.</p>
       
           <p><b>Folklore</b>: As mentioned in Wikipedia, <i>The name Kalsubai has been given to the mountain on the name of the woman who used to live there. According to the villagers living at the base village, long ago, a woman named Kalsubai was punished by the villagers and forced to leave the village. She took refuge on this mountain and started living there. Hence the name, Kalsubai.</i></p>

          <p><b>How to get there ?</b></p>
          <p> Nearest railway station : Kasara</p>
          <p> Base Village: "Bari" </p>

         <p>By car : Private Taxis also go to Bari village, available just outside the station, most of them ride to Nashik.</p>
         <p><b>Tip: </b>Never negotiate directly with a Taxi driver, you may end up paying very high rent. Ask a local about the fares and alternate routes to Bari village. The most popular transit point is Ghoti where you'll get ample taxis to Bari. </p>

         <p>By local transport : Buses are available to Bari village from ST depot which is just a 5min walk on the highway from Kasara railway station.</p> 

         <p><b>THE TREK : </b></p>

        <p>Trekking in the dark is indeed heavily adventurous, with absolutely invisibility and route finding tasks; you’ll have immense fun with your friends. And ofcourse, your torch is your companion who guides you during the night trek.<br>
         We reached the base at around 7 P.M. It was already dark. Dinner wasn't available readily and we needed to start ASAP. The route is very tricky for the first 15 minutes until a temple, the rest is linear ascend. There is a house near this temple where we were served with freshly prepared <i>Kanda Poha</i> and a nice cup of tea. Resuming our journey, we doubled our outfits as the wind was getting cooler. At this point two dogs accompanied us. They were like free guides for the trek who just wanted some food and lots of love. Believe me when I say we took the wrong path just once during our entire journey, a big THANKS to those dogs.
    <br>
     In the dark night, you'll be crushing one of the most delicous fruit on earth which are in abundance on Kalsubai. Do eat them because they are the tastiest and take some home because again you'll miss them. We saw mango trees which looked like Christmas trees. Who did this? The fire flies. <br>
    Midway, around 90-120minutes later, you'll come across a hut housed by a humble elderly couple. They sell everything you need to eat and drink. It's a request whenever you visit this place, please buy anything for their livelihood. And again, they make awesome tea.

    Initially your excitement level will drop only to shoot high later. After another half hour, we came across a cliff which overlooked the lit up Kasara city. The view was beautiful. We rested here few minutes and gazed the star filled sky. I really wanted the time to stop at this time.<br>
    The last hour of the trek is very adventorous. The whole area was foggy. We couldn't see anything beyond 2meters. The weather grew chilly. Every step was taken with care and precaution. We were going slow. Finally we reached the most talked about iron stairs of Kalsubai. This part of the trek is hell scary. Its dark, Its cold, Its inclined, the steps aren't really steps but thin iron strips. We got through this area like snails. <br>
    We weren't very far from the top. But the weather had gone wild. Fog and darkness blinded our vision. We were hungry too. It was around 12 at midnight and we decided to pull our horses and somehow we managed to pitch the tent.  Ofcourse the trek had paused but our fun didn't. The music was ON, food was out.<br>
    Before the dawn, around 5.30 AM, we resumed our trek. Within 15 minutes we had reached the top. It felt like a great achievement to us, It is actually. We had conquered the highest peak in Maharashtra. This was the moment of success. A tick on the bucket list. <br>
   We rested atop an hour and started our descend. There were some points we couldn't believe were risky and had made our way in the dark. Well, that's the beauty of night trek, haha. It took us 2 hours to get down. That was the end of a memorable journey.  <br></p>

<p>This trip had everything in it, night trek, highest peak, fireflies, star gazing and camping. Hence, the ideal time to visit this place during the first 10 days of the month of June. </p>
