           <p>Rajmachi is a special place for me. This was my first trek ever and incidently the first night trek. It was on 31st December 2015, after long planning with my childhood friends, I left for a thrill that will never diminish, the thrill of trekking the forts at night. It took us 4.5 hours (from 6PM to 10.30PM) to reach at Udhewadi after a memorable march from Lonavala. Also we decided not to carry a tent and sleep outside the Kalbhairav temple, It turned out to be the best decision.</p>
       
           <p><b>History</b>: Rajmachi fort was a strategic fort to overlook Borghat which was a historical trade route. The peak has two fortified structures – the Shrivardhan fort and the Manaranjan fort. The fort complex was originally constructed by the Satavahanas. In 1657 CE, Shivaji Maharaj captured this fort along with other neighbouring forts from the Adilshahi ruler of Bijapur. In 1704 CE, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb captured the fort from the Marathas. However, the Marathas regained its control in 1705 CE. In 1713 CE, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj handed over Rajmachi fort to Kanhoji Angre. Eventually in 1818 CE with the fall of Marathas, the British took over Rajmachi Fort.</p>

          <p><b>How to get there ?</b><br>
                      Nearest railway station : Lonavala (16 km) and Karjat (12 km)<br>
                    <b>Base Village:</b> Rajmachi or Udhewadi <br>

            <b>By car</b> : Drive to Lonavala from your place of residence. Park your car in the city and get on a rickshaw or tum-tum for Tungarli lake<br>

            <b>By local transport</b> : Beyond lonavala, there isn't any local transport, except rickshaw till Tungarli lake.<br> 

            <b>Best time to visit</b>: June to February ( You may avoid September-October month coz of post monsoon heat ) <br>

            <b>THE TREK : </b><br>

            Rajmachi Fort consists of the two citadels namely Shrivardhan and Manaranjan Forts, surrounded by a wide plateau. The fort complex consists of huge ramparts, strong walls, massive gateways, residential units, water reservoirs, administrative centers and secret gates for the exit. Kal Bhairav temple is situated in the gorge between Shrivardhan and Manaranjan forts. In the rainy season this region is more beautiful with several waterfalls, streams and lush green forests and meadows.<br>

Ancient Buddhist caves, dated around 200BC, known as Kondhane caves are on the western side of the Rajmachi plateau. There are 8 Buddhist caves of the Himayana sect. Although many stupas, entrance and the floor of the caves were damaged in an earthquake only the Chaitya is intact.<br>

The worst part of going out with my school friends is, we are ill-prepared. No tents. Just 3 torches among 7 people. Lots of food and colas to carry. <br>

The start point of this trek is the beautiful Tungarli lake. We reached this point at around 5.30 which is a perfect to rejuvenate your soul. This could be a very beautiful picnic spot for people who aren't fond of trekking. This lake is at a height greater than the city. Hence, you can see Lonavala city from here. Let the picture say for me about this place.<br>

We left the lake at 6.30PM and headed to our destination. We crossed a small village 20 minutes later where little children bid adieu. It had started to get dark from here. Darkness not only blinds your sight but also your senses especially in the middle of a forest. Half of the group was already suggesting to return. At this very moment we came across a local who guided us and rested our fears by assuring of no dangers on the route. But still, we had google maps on. <br>

Dividing the entire trek in 5 parts helped a lot in minimizing the psychological burden of walking 5 hours. The initial 90 minutes of trek mostly crossing the mountains, uphill and downhill, rest is mainly walking in the middle of the plateau. As it was a full moon day, there was little visibility to our surprise. This part of the trek is very smooth. The key here is to carry lots of water and eatables. There came a place in this stretch where the road was dug out, the sky was covered by the trees,It was like a tunnel. I realised for the first time what it meant to be pitch dark and how silence can be spooky.  We were getting all the wrong thoughts in our mind, those scary scenes from Conjuring, that crunching of dry leaves and twigs, It felt very haunted. But don't we got through it and I wrote blog about it so it isn't haunted :P  <br> 

Finally, we reached Udhewadi at 10.30PM. The village had already wound up their business. A villager approached us and invited us to their house. We dined at his place. Later, we went ahead to Kalbhairav temple which is just 10 minutes from the village. To our surprise there was a halogen outside the temple which meant no hassle to light up a bonfire and safe place to sleep. This place overlooks the Lonavala city as well. We had the best view of the New Year fireworks. <br>

But something happened that should not have happened. A fire broke out near the fort and kept spreading wildy as there was a strong breeze. That fire entered the fort soon. We were shattered to see this. We didn't sleep as well. At 5AM, we went up to see three people sleeping on the entrance of the fort, It was the only place where they could be safe. Further, I saw a group who was trapped on the fort as well. They were lucky to escape this disaster too as they were in the most dry corner of the fort. <br>

Soon it was sunrise time. Time to take some pictures. <br>

Everything is lush green and picturesque. The clouds, green mountain and beautiful meadows around us reminded me what we miss in the concrete jungle. After absorbing this breathtaking views we headed back to the village and then to our homes.
